# RazorEngine CG - ShadowOM
Proposal to optimise RazorEngine compilation of templates with multiple OMs
through introduction of a hidden Shadow OM similar to how Mozilla solved this problem in Web Components.
```csharp
foreach(var type in new [] { typeof(EquipmentPhase), typeof(EquipmentModule) }) {
    Engine.Razor.Compile(template, "templateKey", type);
}
```
Above approach to solving the multiple entity problem causes long term performance setbacks,
it seems that drawing inspiration from the ShadowDOM feature might pose to be a precaution to this issue.
```csharp
var result = Engine.Razor.RunCompile(template, "templateKey", typeof(Shadow), equipmentPhaseOM);
```
This heavily relies on the type structure being changed obviously, a method to retrieve the specified root is necessary,
in this case it will be valid for templates, but the core concept still applies.

Take a look into <code>Shadow.cs</code> to see how this was accomplished.
